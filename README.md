This model implements a Next Word Prediction Model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The model is trained on a custom text corpus and generates meaningful next words based on input text. The implementation leverages the Keras library to build and train the model and uses TensorFlow as the backend.

Features:
Text Preprocessing: The text is cleaned, tokenized, and lemmatized to remove unwanted characters and stopwords, ensuring that the model focuses on the core vocabulary.
LSTM Model Architecture: A sequential model with LSTM layers and embedding layers to capture the relationships between words over time.
Next Word Prediction: Given an input text, the model predicts the next word based on the context using the trained LSTM model.
Top-N Word Suggestions: Instead of predicting only the most likely next word, the model can return the top-N most probable words based on the input text.
Customizable: You can easily adjust the number of predicted words and model parameters such as LSTM units, epochs, and batch size to improve performance.
